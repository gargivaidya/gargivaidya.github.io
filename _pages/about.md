Howdy! Welcome to my personal website.

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree from the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at Texas A & M University (TAMU), College Station, USA. I completed my undergraduate studies in Instrumentation and Control Engineering, from the prestigious College of Engineering, Pune, (CoEP) India. My interest in Control Theory evolved over the years with a graduate project in the area of Process Control under my project guide, Dr. Sudhir Agashe at CoEP. After my graduation, I worked for Johnson Controls Inc. as an Application Engineer in the Building Automation & Controls domain. After a brief stint in the industry, I decided to return back to academia as research is where my passion lies!

During my graduate studies at Texas A & M, I have gradually developed an interest in the fields of Stochastic Control, Optimization and Reinforcement Learning and its applications in the field of cyber-physical systems. I am progressing towards a research thesis under the guidance of my advisor, Dr. Dileep Kalathil. I am highly passionate about autonomous systems and I look forward to apply my skills in the field of automation. 

To introduce myself further, I believe in hardwork and in the idea of 'meraki'. It's a Greek word meaning 'to do something with soul, creativity or love; leaving a piece of yourself in what you are doing'. You can view my [strengths profile](http://academicpages.github.io/files/strengths.pdf).
